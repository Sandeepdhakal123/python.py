"""
Data types in python 
1. There are varieties of data type
   a. None Data type.
   => The none data type mantain the empty state if the variable 

   b. List data type.
   => List data type is the type if data type which is changable or you can modify 
   List data type is used to store a collections of items which is defined using
   Square brackets []

   c. Tuple data Type.
   => Tuple is the non changable data type when you write the code in code editor and you can't modify it.
   Tuple is defined using parentheses.   () 

   d. Set data type.
   => The set data type used to store unordered data collection of unique elements.
   it is denoted by curly bracket {}

   e. Boolen data type.
   => In python boolen data type shows truth values or we can say reasult (True or false).

   f. Dictionary Data type. 
    => In Python, a dictionary is a built-in data type that is used to store collections of key-value pairs.
     Dictionaries are also known as associative arrays, maps, or hash maps in other programming languages. 
     They are defined using curly braces {}, and the key-value pairs are separated by colons 

   g. Intiger Data type.
   => The integer data type is the type which study the intiger value for eg : 1,2,3,4,5,6


   h. Float Data type
   => In python float data type reads the decimal value of the function. for eg: 2.000, 3.1,290.00000020202002

   i. Range data type 
   => In Python, the range type is used to represent an immutable sequence of numbers, 
"""

# # For example of None Data type
result = None 
print(result) #output None 
def some_function():
    pass
result = some_function()
print(result) #output None

#Example of list type
numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
print('numbers')
